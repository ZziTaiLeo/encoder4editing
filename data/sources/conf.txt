#
# MBGS_type should be either:
#   1: knn - use the first MBGS_KNN nearest neighbors out of the background 
#      for each frame
#   2: fixed background size - fill the background with the nearest neighbors 
#      until the background set size is MBGS_BG_SIZE 
#   3: double fixed background size - same as (2), but do it again with 
#      2 * MBGS_BG_SIZE, and combine the results
#   4: knn and fixed background size combined - combine the results of 1 and 2
